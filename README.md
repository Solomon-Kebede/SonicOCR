Switch to branch `dev`

Run `python3 glens.py`

You can change the path to the images in `dev/glens.py`

Works on python version >= 3.6

Tested on python version 3.6 and 3.10

	Instructions:
		
		* clone this repo
	
		* run it on any terminal or IDE
 		
		* Then it asks for an input of image path for single or multiple
		for multiple image paths make sure one path is separated form the
		other with a comma(./image_path_1, ./image_path_2, ./image_path_3)
	
		* It will process the image(s) and pops out the result good luck!!!
